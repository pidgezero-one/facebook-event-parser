# facebook-event-parser
plugin that retrieves Facebook event metadata from your invites and adds it to a wordpress calendar

This might not work anymore, I wrote it a couple years ago before I knew what SQL injection was lol

You make a new Facebook app, put your specific ID codes in the source code, and then it would retrieve your event invites and put them into the database for https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/ which needed to be installed.

I made this for the Ontario Super Smash Bros community hub back in the day when all our events were public. facebook API as far as I remember does not retrieve private events, so I can't use it anymore, but I'm putting the code here in case anyone needs a reference for something similar.
